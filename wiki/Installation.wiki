== Introduction ==

Here you can find information on how to install the upload script. If you want to know more about the functionalities of the script you can look on the [Overview overview] page.


== The upload script and wrapper ==

download the bin directory part of the script from SVN:
{{{
svn checkout http://upload.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bin uploadbin
}}}

or download the tarball and unpack it (make sure to check for the latest version on the [http://code.google.com/p/upload/downloads/list downloads] page):
{{{
wget http://upload.googlecode.com/files/bin-v0.9.1.tar.gz
tar -zxf bin-v0.9.1.tar.gz
rm bin-v0.9.1.tar.gz
}}}

now make the files executable:
{{{
chmod 755 uploadbin/upload
chmod 755 uploadbin/uploadwrap
}}}

and finally move them to the /usr/local/bin/ directory (note: you need either _*root*_ or _*sudo*_ for this):
{{{
mv uploadbin/upload /usr/local/bin/
mv uploadbin/uploadwrap /usr/local/bin/
rm -r uploadbin/
}}}

if you do not have _*root*_ or _*sudo*_ you can also move these files to your local bin directory:
{{{
mv uploadbin/upload ~/bin/
mv uploadbin/uploadwrap ~/bin/
rm -r uploadbin/
}}}


== The home (resource) files ==

to get the files for your home directory move to your homedir:
{{{
cd ~/
}}}

and then download the home directory part of the script from SVN:
{{{
svn checkout http://upload.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/home upload
}}}

or download the tarball and unpack it (make sure to check for the latest version on the [http://code.google.com/p/upload/downloads/list downloads] page):
{{{
wget http://upload.googlecode.com/files/home-v0.9.1.tar.gz
tar -zxf home-v0.9.1.tar.gz
rm home-v0.9.1.tar.gz
}}}

for security make sure you modify the upload resource files so you are the only one being able to access them:
{{{
chmod 600 upload/*.rc
}}}

however the .webui.rc file should be readable for the web user:
{{{
chmod 644 upload/.webui.rc
}}}

the wrapper file should be modified to be executable:
{{{
chmod 700 upload/wrapper
}}}


you can now edit the resource files to configure the uploader, more information about this can be found on the [http://code.google.com/p/upload/wiki/Configuration configuration] page.


== The web files ==

to get the files for the web directory move to the web directory (note: you need either _*root*_ or _*sudo*_ to download files to your web directory):
{{{
cd /var/www/
}}}

and download the web directory part of the script from SVN:
{{{
svn checkout http://upload.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/web uploader
}}}

or download the tarball and unpack it (make sure to check for the latest version on the [http://code.google.com/p/upload/downloads/list downloads] page):
{{{
wget http://upload.googlecode.com/files/web-v0.9.1.tar.gz
tar -zxf web-v0.9.1.tar.gz
rm web-v0.9.1.tar.gz
}}}

you can now edit the settings.php file to configure the uploader webui and add the required line(s) to /etc/sudoers, more information about this can be found on the [http://code.google.com/p/upload/wiki/Configuration configuration] page.
