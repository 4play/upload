== Introduction ==

Here you can find information about the functionalities of the script, example output and WebUI screenshots. If you want information on how to install the script you can look on the [Installation install] page and for configuration you can look at the [Configuration configuration] page.

== The upload process ==

The `upload` script will walk through a couple steps when you execute it to upload a torrent, below are the steps described:

  * logs you in
  * checks for dupe, if found it downloads the torrent
  * creates a torrent
  * checks for dupe again, if found it removes the created torrent and downloads the torrent
  * uploads the torrent
  * runs `rtorrent_fast_resume`
  * moves the torrent to your watchdir
