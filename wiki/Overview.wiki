== Introduction ==

Here you can find information about the functionalities of the script, example output and WebUI screenshots. If you want information on how to install the script you can look on the [Installation install] page and for configuration you can look at the [Configuration configuration] page.

== The upload process ==

The `upload` script will walk through a couple steps when you execute it to upload a torrent, below are the steps described:

  * logs you in
  * checks for dupe, if found it downloads the torrent
  * determines the optimal piece size to use
  * creates a torrent
  * checks for dupe again, if found it removes the created torrent and downloads the torrent
  * uploads the torrent
  * runs `rtorrent_fast_resume`
  * moves the torrent to your watchdir


== Usage ==

The most common usage when only using the `.upload.rc` file for a single site is:
{{{
upload -c "category" /path/to/release/
}}}

or if you use multiple sites:
{{{
upload -r .abbr.rc -c "category" /path/to/release/
}}}
where `.abbr.rc` is the resource file for the specific site.

Other possible options are described below:

|| *option* || *explanation* ||
|| -c `<category>` || upload release to category `<category>` ||
|| -d `<path>` || use `<path>` as your downloads/data directory ||
|| -h || show the command information ||
|| -i || show extended command information ||
|| -l || show available categories ||
|| -o `<file>` || output log of this upload to `<file>` ||
|| -p `<password>` || use `<password>` to log in to the site ||
|| -r `<file>` || use `<file>` as resource file ||
|| -t `<path>` || use `<path>` as path to execute the script in ||
|| -u `<username>` || use `<username>` to log in to the site ||
|| -w `<path>` || use `<path>` as your torrents/watch directory ||
|| -x `<test>` || execute `<test>` as test (possible values: cat, mkt, rfr) ||
|| -y `<number>` || piece size to use (in `2^<number>` bytes) ||
|| -z `<number>` || do NOT use `<number>` bytes as piece size ||


== Output and screenshots ==

=== Example output ===

Here is an example of the output the script would give when you would execute it manually:
{{{

=== WebUI screenshots ===

On the list page you can see different colors for the release names, below are the colors and meanings described:
|| *color* || *meaning* ||
|| green || uploaded (sorted to the bottom) ||
|| blue || uploading ||
|| red || error (reason in between brackets) ||
|| light/dark grey || hidden (sorted to the bottom) ||


There are 3 dropdown boxes behind each release, below are is the reason for each described:
  * #1: piece size - The script will determine the optimal piece size by default, however if you wish to change the piece size (i.e. to avoid dupe hash) you can choose one yourself here.
  * #2: site - here you can select to which site you want to upload
  * #3: category - after you selected which site you want to upload to you can select to which category you want to upload
