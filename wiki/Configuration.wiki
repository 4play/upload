== Introduction ==

Here you can find information on how to configure the upload script files. If you want to know more about the functionalities of the script you can look on the [/Overview overview] page.


== The home (resource) files ==

In the home directory you can find two different kinds of resource files, the .webui.rc file which holds information for the webui, and the `.upload.rc` type files which hold information about the sites you can/want to upload to.


=== The .upload.rc file ===

In the file itself there are already comments with an explanation what the setting is for, however on the following wiki page they are explained in more detail where possible:

== The webui ==

In order to be able to use the webui the web user needs to be able to execute the wrapper file in the users their home upload directory as that user. In order to do so you need to add an extra line in the `/etc/sudoers` file. To do so you need to run the following command as *root* or *sudo*:
{{{
visudo
}}}
This should open the `/etc/sudoers.tmp` file where you can add the following line:
{{{
www-data ALL=(user1, user2) NOPASSWD: /home/user1/upload/wrapper, /home/user2/upload/wrapper
}}}
Of course you need to replace user1 and user2 with the user(s) you want to be able to use the webui upload command.

In the webui directory there is only one file you need to edit which is the `settings.php` file. You can however if you want to add more .css files, this can be easily done by copying either the `light.css` or `dark.css` file and replacing the values.
